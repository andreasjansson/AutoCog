Given the predict.py and cog.yaml files and error message above, fix the predict.py file so that the error goes away.

First, think step-by-step.

Then, return the entire predict.py file since I intend to use your output programmatically to replace the contents of predict.py with whatever you output. Wrap the file contents in {% file_start "predict.py" %} and {% file_end "predict.py" %}.
