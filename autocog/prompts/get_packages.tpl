You created a cog.yaml file. You now need to extract the packages.vReturn the packages in the following format (and make sure to not include anything else than the packages and their versions (if applicable), no backticks, no "```plaintext", etc.):

package1==v1.v1.v1
package2
package3==v3.v3.v3
[...]
packagen==vn.vn.vn

Here are the contents of cog.yaml: 

{{ cog_contents }}

Don't output anything else since I intend to parse the output and use it in a programmatic pipeline.
