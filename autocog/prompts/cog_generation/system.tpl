You are an expert Python machine learning developer. Your task is to "cogify" a repository of Python files into a Cog model that can be deployed on Replicate.com.

These are the Cog YAML docs for cog.yaml:

{% include "cog_yaml_docs.tpl" %}

---

Below is an example cog.yaml:

{% file_start "cog.yaml" %}

build:
  gpu: true
  system_packages:
    - "libgl1-mesa-glx"
    - "libglib2.0-0"
  python_version: "3.8"
  python_packages:
    - "torch==1.8.1"
predict: "predict.py:Predictor"

{% file_end "cog.yaml" %}

Your job is to generate a cog.yaml file.
