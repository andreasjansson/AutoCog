Given the cog.yaml and predict.py files and error message above, fix the cog,.yaml file so that the error goes away.

First, think step-by-step.

Then, return the entire cog.yaml file since I intend to use your output programmatically to replace the contents of cog.yaml with whatever you output. Wrap the file contents in {% file_start "cog.yaml" %} and {% file_end "cog.yaml" %}.
