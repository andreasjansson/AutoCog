Below is an example of a cog predict command:

cog predict -i input1=@input.jpg -i input2=foo

Return a cog predict command for the latest version of the predict.py file that you generated above. Wrap the command in the strings {{ command_start }} and {{ command_end }}. Don't output any other text before or after the strings since I intend to execute the output that you generate in a Python programming environment.
